Airport runways are numbered using a 2-digit number, like 09. The meaning generally is that planes taking off or landing on that runway will be facing a number of degrees rotated right from north, with the ending 0 left out (Ex. 09 is 90 degrees, 27 is 270 degrees). A runway numbered 09 is facing 90 degrees right from north, namely facing east. Given a runway number (integer), output the degrees followed by the closest direction indication (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, or northwest). If the input is 03, the output is: 30 degrees (northeast).

Hints:
    First just read the input number, multiply by 10 to yield runway_deg.
    Next, create an if-else statement to compare runwayDeg's value with ranges for each direction. For north, the value should be within -22.5 and +22.5. For northeast, the value should be between 45 - 22.5 and 45 + 22.5. And so on.
    Based on the range in which the value falls, update a string variable with the direction. Then after the if-else, have a single output statement that outputs "270 degrees (north)" or whatever value and direction are correct.
    Don't forget that ranges use &. An expression detecting a value x is between 1 and 10 is (x > 1) & (x < 10).
    Because the input is an integer which is multiplied by 10 to yield runway_deg, the comparisons with floating-point values like 22.5 will never result in equality. Hence, the ranges don't have to account for such quality.
