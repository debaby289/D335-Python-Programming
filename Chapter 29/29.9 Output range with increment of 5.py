'''
Write a program whose input is two integers. Output the first integer and subsequent increments of 5 as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:
    -15
    10
the output is:
-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 

Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:
20
5
the output is:
Second integer can't be less than the first.

For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last. End the output with a newline.
