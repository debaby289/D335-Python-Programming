Docstring for Chapter 7.Labs.7.19.1 LAB Driving costs - functions
Write a function driving_cost() with parameters miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon, and miles_driven, that returns the dollar cost to drive those miles. All items are of type float. The function called with arguments (20.0, 3.1599, 50.0) returns 7.89975.

The main program's inputs are the car's miles per gallon and the price of gas in dollars per gallon (both float). Output the gas cost for 10 miles, 50 miles, and 400 miles, by calling your driving_cost() function three times.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'{your_value:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:
20.0
3.1599

the output is:
1.58
7.90
63.20

Your program must define and call a function:
def driving_cost(miles_per_gallon, dollars_per_gallon, miles_driven)
'''
# Define your function here.
def driving_cost(miles_per_gallon,dollars_per_gallon,miles_driven):
    gas_cost = (dollars_per_gallon / miles_per_gallon) * miles_driven
    return gas_cost


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Type your code here.
    mph = float(input())
    dpg = float(input())

    print(f'{driving_cost(mph,dpg,miles_driven=10):.2f}')
    print(f'{driving_cost(mph,dpg,miles_driven=50):.2f}')
    print(f'{driving_cost(mph,dpg,miles_driven=400):.2f}')
