'''
Task:
Create a solution that accepts an integer input representing water temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Output a description of the water state based on the following scale:
    If the temperature is below 33° F, the water is “Frozen”.
    If the water is between 33° F and 80° F (including 33°), the water is “Cold”.
    If the water is between 80° F and 115° F (including 80°), the water is "Warm".
    If the water is between 115° F and 211° F (including 115°) , the water is “Hot".
    If the water is greater than or equal to 212° F, the water is “Boiling”.

Additionally, output a safety comment only during the following circumstances:
    If the water is exactly 212° F, the safety comment is, "Caution: Hot!"
    If the water temperature is less than 33° F, the safety comment is, "Watch out for ice!"

The solution output should be in the format:
    water_state
    optional_safety_comment

Sample Input and Output:
If the input is
Enter the water temperature:
    118
then the expected output is
    Hot

Alternatively, if the input is
Enter the water temperature:
    32
then the expected output is
    Frozen
    Watch out for ice!
