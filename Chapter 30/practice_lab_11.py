Task:
Create a solution that accepts a string input representing a grocery store item and an integer input identifying the number of items purchased on a recent visit. The following dictionary purchase lists available items as the key and the cost per item as the value.

purchase = {"bananas": 1.85, "steak": 19.99, "cookies": 4.52, "celery": 2.81, "milk": 4.34}

Additionally,
    If fewer than 10 items are purchased, the price is the full cost per item.
    If between 10 and 20 items (inclusive) are purchased, the purchase gets a 5% discount.
    If 21 or more items are purchased, the purchase gets a 10% discount.
    Output the chosen item and the total purchase cost to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format:
    quantity item_purchased total cost: $total_purchase_cost

Sample Input and Output:
If the input is
    bananas
    12
then the expected output is
    12 bananas total cost: $21.09

Alternatively, if the input is
    cookies
    144
then the expected output is
    144 cookies total cost: $585.79
