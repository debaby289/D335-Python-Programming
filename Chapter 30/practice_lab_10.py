Task:
Create a solution that accepts an integer input identifying how many different shares of stock are purchased from the Old Town Stock Exchange, followed by an equivalent number of string inputs representing the stock selections. 

The following dictionary, stock, lists available stock selections as the key and the cost per selection as the value.
    stocks = {'TSLA': 912.86 , 'BBBY': 24.84, 'AAPL': 174.26, 'SOFI': 6.92, 'KIRK': 8.72, 'AURA': 22.12, 'AMZN': 141.28, 'EMBK': 12.29, 'LVLU': 2.33}

Output the total cost of the purchased shares of stock to two decimal places.

The solution output should be in the format:
    Total price: $cost_of_stocks

Sample Input and Output:
If the input is
Enter a quantity of stocks followed by stock symbol(s):
    3
    SOFI
    AMZN
    LVLU
then the expected output is
    Total price: $150.53

Alternatively, if the input is
Enter a quantity of stocks followed by stock symbol(s):
    2
    KIRK
    TSLA
then the expected output is
    Total price: $921.58
